Relictium is an unofficial fork of [Vintagium (by Asek3)](https://github.com/Asek3/sodium-1.12), itself an unofficial fork of [CaffeineMC's “Sodium”](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium), ported to Minecraft 1.12.2 and designed to work with Forge Mod Loader. This mod significantly improves the performance of Minecraft 1.12.2 by rewriting the game's rendering engine for smoother and faster gameplay. 🚀
